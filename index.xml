No other textile can compete with jute when it comes to odour retention.
Because the extremely absorbent jute inside fibres serve as a sponge for the pet pee, it is not necessary to use the synthetic plastic fibres to soak up the pet urine.

東洋アジア最大の歓楽街と呼ばれる歌舞伎町で生まれ育ったということで、生い立ちが複雑なのではないか？と思われることが多いです。
経歴を辿ってみると、渋谷さんが医学部出身という説があったり、兄貴がいるという噂があったりと、かなり嘘が多いです。
今日は渋谷龍太さんの実家と家族についてまとめ、ネットで噂されている学歴や兄弟の間違いについて書いてみたいと思います。
渋谷龍太の最終学歴は服部栄養専門学校。医学部はガセネタ！実家の中華料理店” ネット上では、渋谷龍太さんに対して、
”実は有名大学の医学部出身のエリートではないか？”という噂があります。
しかし、残念ながらそれはガセネタです。
渋谷龍太さんの学歴は、高校は東京都立目黒高校で、高校を卒業した後は調理の専門学校である”服部栄養専門学校”に進学し卒業されています。
渋谷龍太さんが料理の専門学校に進んだ理由は、実家が中華料理屋という影響です。
渋谷さんが医学部出身だというデマが出てしまったのは、渋谷さんのラジオに”テスラは泣かない”のボーカル・村上学さんがゲストで出演したことが発端です。
村上学さんが中高に名門男子校で寮生活を送り、大学は医学部卒業だったというトークをした影響から情報が混じってネットに残ってしまったのです。
渋谷龍太の新宿の実家は中華料理屋「昇龍」。家業を継ぐ意思で調理師の専門に進学していた 現在、売れっ子バンドマンとして活躍されている渋谷龍太さんですが、最終学歴が調理の専門学校というのはかなり意外です。
渋谷さんが調理師の学校に進学した理由は、過去にインタビューの中で答えられています。
僕の家は新宿の中華料理屋で父がコックなんです。高校の頃は何も考えていなかったから、そのまま家業を継ぐんだなーと漠然と思っていて、高校卒業後に調理師の学校に行ったんです。はい、調理師免許を持っています、こう見えても真面目に授業受けていましたから(笑)。で、その調理師学校在学中に、バンドでコンテストに優勝したことがあって、メジャーレーベルから声が掛かってデビューしたんです。
渋谷さんの新宿歌舞伎町にある実家は、中華料理屋の「昇龍（ショウリュウ）」です。
「龍太」の名前も店から取ったとされます。
高校を卒業したばかりの頃はバンドで成功する志もなかったことから、家業を継ごうと服部栄養専門学校に進学されたということです。
「昇龍」はファンの方のみならず、たくさんの常連さんが行きつけにしている評価の高いお店で、ばら肉そば、五目焼きそばなどが看板メニューの美味しいと評判です。
渋谷龍太は高校時代に焼肉屋・たこ焼き屋でバイト。下積み時代も居酒屋でバイト 実家が飲食店だったことから料理の専門に進んだ渋谷さんですが、実は高校時代にも焼肉屋・たこ焼き屋のバイトをしており、本人も元々は飲食の世界が好きだったようです。
実家が中華料理屋なんですけど、厨房に立ってる父ちゃんの背中を見ていてカッコいいなと思って。僕はこういう大人になりたいなっていう像は父と母から教わっている部分が大きいんですけど。
メジャーから解約された後は、居酒屋でバイトをしながら生計を立てていたこともあったそうで、調理学校で学んだスキルは大人になった後も生きたことになります。
学生時代に2つ、メジャー契約が切れた後に23才からの5年間働いた居酒屋のアルバイトを入れると合計3つですね。学生時代はお小遣いのためでしたけど、居酒屋で働いていた頃は生きることと直結していたので意味合いは全然違いました。
ただ、バンド時代に居酒屋を選んだ理由は、バンド活動の都合でシフトで働ける飲食でないダメだっただけで、好き好みで働いてたわけではないようです。
渋谷龍太の家族構成。ひとりっ子で兄弟はいないが”兄”のように従うHi-Giのメンバー 新宿歌舞伎町の中華料理店が実家の渋谷龍太さん。
家族構成は、父・母・龍太さんの３人だけです。
父と母は共働きで、家で一人でいることが多かったそうですが、新宿の子供は共働きの親が多く、一緒に遊べる友達は常にいたそうです。
両親は仕事が忙しくても、家族３人で新宿ピカデリーまで映画を見に行ったり、歌舞伎町の子供らしい遊び方をしていました。
母は本の編集者の仕事をしており、渋谷さんは母に勧められた本が面白かった影響で、学生時代は授業中も本読むほど読書にのめり込み、そのせいで先生から学年文集の執筆を任されて苦労したそうです。
2022年に小説「都会のラクダ」を執筆したのも、母親の影響があったからだそうです。
父親は実家の「昇龍」のシェフで、渋谷さんは子供の頃から厨房立つ父の背中がかっこいいと憧れていたそうです。
「父親は人に慕われるような人だ」と渋谷さんは尊敬しています。
過去に父が20歳の頃の写真をツイッターにアップしたことがあります。
お父さんは洋楽のハードロックが好きで、子供の頃は家でレッド・ツェッペリンやブラック・サバスなどうるさい音楽が流れていたそうです。
父がロックばかり聴いてた反動で、小学5年の頃に聞いたオフコースが”うるさくない”と感動してファンになったそうです。
渋谷龍太に兄はいないがHi-Gi・ワンスが”兄貴分”。顔も背丈もそっくり 一部ネットで、渋谷龍太さんに兄貴がいるような記述をされている記事がありますが、あれらの記事は間違っています。
渋谷龍太さんはラジオやメディアで正式に”ひとりっこ”だと発言しています。
ただ、過去のSNSなどの投稿で、あたかも実の兄がいるような、紛らわしい投稿をしていたのは事実です。
「よし、息抜き。 Hi-Giのワンス君（a.k.a.横暴な兄）と飯でも食ってくる。 ここは渋谷ハチ公前、二人とも、実にこの街が、似合わない。」2012年8月24日
「今晩は横浜で過ごした。 お酒を飲んで兄貴と遊んだ。 写真は左から 兄（Hi-Gi、ワンスくん） 私 伝説（ECHO、いちげんさん） 良い夜も、素晴らしい一日も、自ら迎えに行かなきゃな。」2013年12月20日
「本日はライブを観に行きました。 時間の関係でHi-Giと、WORLD JUNKしか観られなかったが、とても楽しかった。 兄と、そして仲道と。」2014年12月10日
「兄貴とご飯でした。 横浜のHi-Giって最高にかっこいいバンドやってる自慢の兄貴。 9ヶ月遅れの誕生日プレゼントありがとう。 偏屈だけど、かっこよくて、やっぱり偏屈。」2016年2月20日
過去に何度も”お兄ちゃん”と書いて投稿しているので、何も知らない人が”あ、兄も音楽やってて仲良しなんだ”と勘違いしてしまっているのです。
渋谷龍太さんは、Hi-Giという関東ローカルのロックバンドのメンバー・ワンスと仲が良く、”兄”と呼んで慕っているだけです。
ワンスさんは鼻筋や口元、背丈（同じ１６６センチ前後？）の雰囲気が似てるので、本当の兄弟に見えるのは仕方ないですが。
ただの兄貴分なだけで、本当に血が繋がっている兄弟ではないので、勘違いしないようにしましょう！</description></item><item><title>Clayne Crawford Bio, Married, Wife (Sunshine Kiki Brown), Kids, Family</title><link>/clayne-crawford-bio-married-wife-sunshine-kiki-brown-kids-family.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/clayne-crawford-bio-married-wife-sunshine-kiki-brown-kids-family.html</guid><description>Few Clayne Crawford fans know he wasn’t born with that name.&amp;nbsp;The American actor and former&amp;nbsp;Lethal Weapon&amp;nbsp;star was born Joseph Crawford and was called “Joey” while growing up in Alabama.&amp;nbsp;Her fate with screens may not have been her exact choice during her youth, but fate always plays tricks on us as we wander through life.
