However, The Crown’s creators have never made it a secret that much of the show is a work of fiction, with many imagined moments filling the blanks in the royal family’s history. So how much of the new season was fact, and what was made up? Find out in our ultimate guide here…&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Did Dodi and his ex-girlfriend Kelly Fisher break up over Diana?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=eRw10G8MfMH data-wc=38>Dodi Fayed and Kelly Fisher's breakup is contentious, to say the least. After meeting in July 1996, the model alleged that they were already engaged, when she learnt of Dodi's blossoming relationship with Princess Diana the following year.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=ehIvctWgXlN data-wc=83>According to Kelly, it was the famous paparazzi photos of Dodi and Diana, published in The Sunday Mirror, that alerted her to their relationship. Kelly quickly followed up with a lawsuit against Dodi, alleging a breach of contract. During a press conference Kelly's attorney, Gloria Allred, said: "Mr. Fayed needs to take responsibility for the woman that he 'left at the altar' and treated with such total disrespect. He threw her love away in a callous way with no regard for her whatsoever."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d4fe31e7a98a-thcrowntrailerimages5-1.jpg><p id=eoREHE9hsy data-wc=69>Kelly also invited Princess Diana to meet with her, with the intention of sharing a "great deal of information" about Dodi, that was not public knowledge. As for Dodi's take on the matter, the film producer stated that while he knew Kelly, the two were never engaged. Keeping quiet on the topic of their breakup, a spokesman for Harrods, which was owned by Dodi's father Mohamed al-Fayed, responded instead.</p><p id=eJ8DWJ4N4_ data-wc=27>&nbsp;"We are content to leave it to the good sense of the British and American people to judge this development for what it is," read the statement.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Did Dodi's ex-girlfriend Kelly Fisher really sue him following their split?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=euSK7Zpu87p data-wc=87>Yes. Days after photos of Dodi Fayed and Princess Diana were published in The Sunday Mirror, his ex-girlfriend Kelly Fisher lawyered up. Enlisting the help of attorney Gloria Allred, the American model sued Dodi for breach of contract. Alleging that they were due to wed on August 9 1997, Kelly also stated that there had been a contractual agreement between them. The lawsuit contended that prior to ending their relationship, Dodi had offered Kelly $500,000 to scale back her modelling career, and move to Paris with him.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bad27e8b1a00-dodi-al-fayed-kelly-fisher-d.jpg><p id=eUjDoDpihih data-wc=100>At the time, Kelly's lawsuit sought the remaining $440,000, plus damages. After her complaint was filed, Dodi stated that while he knew Kelly, they were never engaged. Although the model intended to secure reparations, she chose to drop the lawsuit, following the sudden and tragic death of Dodi and Diana. On September 1 1997 – a day after the fatal collision – Kelly's attorney confirmed that she had withdrawn the lawsuit, explaining: &nbsp;"Out of respect for the tragedy, and tremendous loss the Fayed family has suffered, she has authorised me as her attorney, to dismiss her lawsuit against Mr Fayed.&nbsp;</p><p id=eSsBqgL4cC data-wc=26>"Although she does have the legal right to pursue the lawsuit against his estate after his death, she has voluntarily chosen not to exercise that right."</p><h3><strong>Did Diana call William ‘Wombat’?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=e6boJsrAUQIP data-wc=75>In a 2007 interview with NBC, Prince William revealed his mother's unusual nickname for him and it was, indeed, Wombat. Speaking to the network, the royal recalled: "When we went to Australia with our parents, and the wombat, you know, that's the local animal, so I just basically got called that, not because I look like a wombat, or maybe I do. I can't get rid of it now. It began when I was two."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/03e751590f46-the-crown-diana-harry-william.jpg><h3><strong>Did Dodi visit a psychic with Diana in Derbyshire?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=emur2nSpCukR data-wc=72>On 12 August 1997, Dodi and Diana attended a psychic reading with her pal, Rita Rogers, one of the UK's best-known mediums. In a 2008 interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Mail Online</a>, it was reported that Diana and Rita had been in touch since 1994, after being introduced by a mutual friend. Chartering the Harrods helicopter, the Princess and her beau had flown to Rita's home in Derbyshire, where Dodi sat for a private reading.&nbsp;</p><p id=eOw7lwF5QPm data-wc=65>"Diana had visited several times before on her own, and we spoke regularly as friends," Rita told the publication. "I'd read for her several times, of course, but not on this occasion.

Diana's voice coach and friend Stewart Pearce echoed this in a 2021 interview with the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Daily Mail</a>.

She was accused of using the campaign to boost her own image, which was nasty and upset her. "So she contacted us and said she didn't want all the hassle that would be waiting for her in the UK.
