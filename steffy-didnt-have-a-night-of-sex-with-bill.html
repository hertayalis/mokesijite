He wanted to give her a heads up that he planned to tell his wife about their shared kisses. Once again he put Sally before Steffy.</p><p>After talking to Sally he then goes home to tell Steffy what happened. He shares the information about his kisses which happened when they thought that they may not make it out. I think that Liam felt that this would minimize the impact of the kisses. Steffy, however, zeroed in on the fact that when he thought that he might not make it out that instead of thinking about the fact that he might leave the woman who loved him a widow he was busy kissing another woman. Steffy recalled how Liam has been putting Sally before her for months and that he was willing to sacrifice his life so that Sally could have her dream. Steffy’s dreams of her life with him were not as important as Sally’s dream of rebuilding Spectra at that location. Steffy points out to Liam that he has been going above and beyond to ensure that Sally gets her wish. Liam can not tell her that whatever is between Sally and him is over. Steffy says that she is no longer willing to play second fiddle in his life. Steffy leaves.</p><p>Wyatt comes over to check upnon his brother. Liam tells Wyatt about Steffy’s reaction to the news that he was busy kissing Sally while they were trapped. Wyatt let him know that he felt that Liam was involved with Sally and he helps Liam to understand where Steffy is coming from. Liam thinks that he has to make things right with Steffy.</p><p>Wyatt goes back to the office and he tells Bill about the fight that Liam and Steffy had.</p><p>Steffy was driving around and she felt that she shouldn’t be driving when she was so upset so she went to the cottage at her grandfather’s. She didn’t want to talk to anyone.</p><p>Bill finds her. The writers never showed us what Bill said that put Steffy in his arms. My theory is that while Bill was ranting how Liam had been busy putting Sally’s dreams ahead of those of his family. I think that Bill told Steffy that he had offered to cover all of the costs of relocating Spectra Fashions but this was not good enough for Liam. This makes what Liam did more than just trying to right Bill’s wrongs to Steffy. This would have just made Steffy feel even more that she had lost out to Sally.</p><p>Just because they fell asleep after having sex does not mean that she had sex all night.</p><p>Someone posted transcript that Quinn and Eric were getting ready to have dinner when Quinn thought that she heard a car leaving the guest house. Steffy left and went home to Liam so the car that Quinn heard would have been Bill’s.</p><p>Steffy was trying to tell Liam whay happened but he wasn’t ready to near anything beyond the fact that she forgave him. Liam talked about his plan to have the vow renewal as a fresh start and they could just forget what they both had done wrong. Then Carter stopped by after work as Liam had requested. Carter did the vow renewal the same day that Liam told Sally that he was going to tell Steffy about the kiss.</p><p>And when Steffy woke up and found out it was Bill next to her, she had a look of horror not a look of happiness. I still say Bill took advantage of her at a vulnerable time, Bill knew what he was doing. Not to excuse what Steffy did but she did not do it because she loves Bill.</p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/l/e79b87/48.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> LoreneA:<p>And when Steffy woke up and found out it was Bill next to her, she had a look of horror not a look of happiness.

He shares the information about his kisses which happened when they thought that they may not make it out. I think that Liam felt that this would minimize the impact of the kisses. Steffy, however, zeroed in on the fact that when he thought that he might not make it out that instead of thinking about the fact that he might leave the woman who loved him a widow he was busy kissing another woman. Steffy recalled how Liam has been putting Sally before her for months and that he was willing to sacrifice his life so that Sally could have her dream. Steffy’s dreams of her life with him were not as important as Sally’s dream of rebuilding Spectra at that location. Steffy points out to Liam that he has been going above and beyond to ensure that Sally gets her wish. Liam can not tell her that whatever is between Sally and him is over. Steffy says that she is no longer willing to play second fiddle in his life. Steffy leaves.</p><p>Wyatt comes over to check upnon his brother. Liam tells Wyatt about Steffy’s reaction to the news that he was busy kissing Sally while they were trapped. Wyatt let him know that he felt that Liam was involved with Sally and he helps Liam to understand where Steffy is coming from. Liam thinks that he has to make things right with Steffy.</p><p>Wyatt goes back to the office and he tells Bill about the fight that Liam and Steffy had.</p><p>Steffy was driving around and she felt that she shouldn’t be driving when she was so upset so she went to the cottage at her grandfather’s. She didn’t want to talk to anyone.</p><p>Bill finds her. The writers never showed us what Bill said that put Steffy in his arms. My theory is that while Bill was ranting how Liam had been busy putting Sally’s dreams ahead of those of his family. I think that Bill told Steffy that he had offered to cover all of the costs of relocating Spectra Fashions but this was not good enough for Liam. This makes what Liam did more than just trying to right Bill’s wrongs to Steffy. This would have just made Steffy feel even more that she had lost out to Sally.</p><p>Just because they fell asleep after having sex does not mean that she had sex all night.</p><p>Someone posted transcript that Quinn and Eric were getting ready to have dinner when Quinn thought that she heard a car leaving the guest house. Steffy left and went home to Liam so the car that Quinn heard would have been Bill’s.</p><p>Steffy was trying to tell Liam whay happened but he wasn’t ready to near anything beyond the fact that she forgave him. Liam talked about his plan to have the vow renewal as a fresh start and they could just forget what they both had done wrong. Then Carter stopped by after work as Liam had requested. Carter did the vow renewal the same day that Liam told Sally that he was going to tell Steffy about the kiss.</p><p>This is how I saw it too. Steffy was a wreck and Liam kept shushing her and telling her she didn’t have to say anything. At that point, after his conversation with Wyatt, Liam realized what he had done was wrong and wanted to make it up to Steffy. What Steffy did wrong was - 1) not telling Liam to shut up that she had something to tell him, and 2) after telling Liam what happened with Bill she should have told Liam it was over because she was tired of him having to find appreciation from another female. He did it repeatedly with Hope / Steffy and now was doing the same game with Sally. I agree that Bill probably told Steffy what you surmise. I am also amazed that as of yet no one has told Hope Liam’s part in all of this. And I think the one to tell Hope should be Wyatt.</p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/b/ce7236/48.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> bethonly: <img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/l/e79b87/48.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> LoreneA:<p>And when Steffy woke up and found out it was Bill next to her, she had a look of horror not a look of happiness.

Liam was paying more attention to Sally than what was needed and let’s be real here…Steffy was doing the same thing with Bill. Steffy went along with the Caroline lie, she harped on Liam blackmailing his father, she allowed Bill to get a little too close and ate up his praise all the while allowing Bill to bash Liam.</p><p>I must have missed an episode where Steffy was going to come clean about sleeping with Bill because last thing I remember was girlfriend swearing to take their night of sleaze to the grave…Steffy had plenty of chances to tell Liam before Liam found that test but she didn’t want to and if Liam hadn’t pressed her she wouldn’t have said a word.</p><p>No amount of shushing from Liam would have stopped Steffy from coming clean about sleeping with Bill…IF SHE WANTED TO !!!..Steffy didn’t want to come clean.

Hadn’t she been looking through the rubble at the Spectra Designs Building for quite a long time??? Long enough time, that Liam and Sally were sure they were going to die??? So That meant that Steffy would have become more and more upset and full of panic when the hours went on and on and they hadn’t yet found them dead or alive. So, someone would be perfectly normal and thinking straight after looking HOURS and HOURS for the body of your possibly dead husband? Then after finding him, you find out he is acting strange, and is more interested in the girl he was stuck in the building with, than you? You are so upset that you go to your grandfathers guest house to cry and try and think through the jumbled mess in your mind. Your FIL finds about about the fight between You and Liam, through Wyatt! Bill, finds Steffy, tells her he wants to comfort her — and then upsets and jumbles her mind even more when he starts bad-mouthing Liam and talking about how great he assumes Liam is treating Sally verses how badly he is treating Steffy. That was the breaking point for Steffy! You say she wasn’t drugged, and she wasn’t drunk. But having found Liam in the circumstances that she did and then having Bill talking about “Liam’s Betrayal” – was enough to make Steffy not be her normal self, and basically be in shock. People in shock don’t act normally! <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/astonished.png title=:astonished: alt=:astonished: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/astonished.png title=:astonished: alt=:astonished: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/astonished.png title=:astonished: alt=:astonished: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/l/58f4c7/48.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> ladyviola:<p>In the flashbacks shiwn, it appeared to be hours & hours of passion in multiple positions… Sure looked like a full night of passion to me.</p><p>Followed by morning after regret. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sunglasses.png title=:sunglasses: alt=:sunglasses: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Yes writers have shown us that both Steffy and Bill were enjoying the foreplay .
